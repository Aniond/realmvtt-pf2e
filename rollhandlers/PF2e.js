  Adjusted:
    "The equipment comes with an adjustment described in its entry.

If the adjustment alters the item's base statistics, such as adding the noisy trait, that's reflected in the equipment's table entry.",
  Adjustment:
    "Items with this trait are intended to alter existing pieces of equipment, typically armors, shields, and weapons. The given item will note which type of equipment it modifies. A piece of equipment can only be affected by a single adjustment at a time. Unless otherwise noted, adding or removing an adjustment requires using a 10-minute activity and a repair kit.",

  Apex: "<p>When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attributes, either increasing the attribute's modifier by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever would give you a higher value. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture ends. For example, in addition to increasing rolls you make using the attribute, increasing your Intelligence lets you become trained in an additional skill and learn a new language, and increasing your Constitution gives you more Hit Points.</p><p>An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it's invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don't gain the attribute modifier increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item.</p>",

    "A type of planar scion descended from a being from Axis, the Plane of Law.",

    "<p>Apparitions are spiritual entities who generally lack the power, cohesiveness, or attachments to enter or affect the physical world. Unlike a ghost or phantom, an apparition does not need to have ever been a living creature and could be the spiritual memory of a particularly meaningful location or event. Apparitions are reliant on animists to interact with other people and things, and generally can't be targeted or affected by spells and abilities other than those of the animist they are attuned to. Animist feats and abilities that affect spirits affect apparitions only if they specifically say so.</p><p> Animist abilities with the apparition trait involve one or more of your apparitions acting alongside you. You must be attuned to at least one apparition to use an apparition ability, and some abilities might state in their requirements more specifically which apparition you must be attuned to.

For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary.

A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.",

Unlike for a suit of armor, barding's Strength entry is listed as a modifier, not a score. Barding can't be etched with magic runes, though special magical barding might be available.",

Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer. It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class.

  Coda: "<p>Instruments with the coda trait work mostly like staves and have the staff trait. There are two differences: Coda instruments are in the form of musical instruments, and they can be prepared only by bards.

The first creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly, the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately when the poison touches its skin.

If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the firearm, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.",

An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.",

  Dedication:
    "Each archetype's dedication feat represents your character's dedicated effort learning a new set of abilities, making it impossible to split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same time.

You can't retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.",

Unless otherwise noted, this space must be adjacent to you and on the ground, and the item needs to have enough open space to expand into or else the activation has no effect. When the effect ends, the expanded item disintegrates if it's a consumable or shrinks back to its normal size if it's not a consumable.",
  Exemplar: "This indicates abilities from the exemplar class.",
  Experiment:
    "An experimental cryptid has been purposefully altered through alchemy, engineering, magic, or ritual to contain some degree of construct components. Although powerful, the process is volatile and imperfect.",

    "An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.",
  Extradimensional:
    "This effect or item creates an extradimensional space. An extradimensional effect placed inside another extradimensional space ceases to function until it is removed.",
  Fatal:
    "The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon's damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.",
  FatalAim:
    "It's possible to hold the stock of this weapon under one arm so you can fire it with a single hand as long as the other hand isn't holding a weapon, shield, or anything else you would need to move and position, to ensure the weapon doesn't slip out from under your arm. However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly more complicated than just releasing one hand from the weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must do so with an Interact action rather than Releasing or as part of reloading.",
  Fear: "Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.",
  Fetchling:
    "A creature with this trait is a member of the fetchling ancestry. Fetchlings were once human, but generations of life in the Netherworld have transformed them.",
  Fey: "Creatures of the First World are called the fey.",

  Figurehead:
    "While many ships are adorned with decorative carvings, daring crews sometimes procure magical figureheads for their vessels.",
  Finesse:
    "You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.",
  Finisher:
    "Finishers are spectacular finishing moves. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. If your finisher succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead.",
  Finite: "Planes with this trait consist of a limited amount of space.",
  Fire: "Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage, or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a connection to magical fire.",
  Fleshwarp:
    "A humanoid transformed so completely by outside forces that they are now a unique ancestry.",
  Flexible:
    "The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to Acrobatics or Athletics checks.",
  Flourish:
    "Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.",
  Focus:
    "Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific source. You can learn focus spells only through special class features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points—you can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly, you can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells.",
  Focused:
    "An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn't count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can't gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items.",
  Foldaway:
    "<p>This shield can collapse into a smaller form attached to a gauntlet for stability and easy travel. You can use an Interact action to deploy or stow the shield. While it's deployed, you can Raise the Shield as long as you have that hand free or are holding an object of light Bulk that's not a weapon in that hand. The shield impedes the use of your hand while it's deployed. Though you can still hold items in that hand, you can't wield weapons in that hand, operate anything that takes two hands, or attack with the gauntlet.</p><p>A foldaway shield must be attached to a gauntlet for stability. It can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the shield from a previous gauntlet, if necessary. If the gauntlet is destroyed, the foldaway shield can usually be salvaged. The collapsible nature of the shield makes it impossible to affix an attached weapon to it.</p>",
  Force:
    "Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.",
  Forceful:
    "This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.",
  Fortune:
    "A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
  FreeHand:
    "This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.",
  Fulu: "Fulus are small paper charms that can be affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, a weapon, a creature, or even a structure. Some fulus are composed of multiple such charms, taking effect only once all have been affixed. Normal fulus have effects immediately once affixed, while fulu talismans have an effect only once activated. Once a fulu has been activated, it lasts for the given duration and then burns out. Unless otherwise noted, fulus expire one year after being created, reverting to mundane paper. All fulus have the fulu and consumable traits. Fulus also have a tradition trait—either arcane, divine, occult or primal—determined by the magical tradition of its creator. For example, a fulu created by a priest would have the divine trait, whereas a witch who dabbles in fate might create a fulu with the occult trait. Some fulus also have the talisman trait, if they work similarly to talismans (such as being affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, or a weapon. Each fulu's stat block indicates the type of item or creature it can be affixed to. Affixing or removing a fulu requires using the Affix a Fulu activity, or the Affix a Talisman action instead if the fulu is also a talisman.",

  Graft:
    "<p>An item that has the graft trait is a living tissue sample that has been implanted into a host. It's permanently a part of the subject's body and reduces the number of items that creature can invest per day by 1. Each graft has the invested trait to indicate this limitation—a graft is like an invested item that the host creature has no choice but to invest. If a creature gets a new graft when their limit on invested items has already been reduced to zero, the host body rejects the graft. Once fully implanted, a graft cannot take damage separately.</p><p>If a graft is ever severed from the host body, it can be reattached by any effect that can typically reattach limbs or organs, such as the regenerate spell. A grafter can remove a grant using the same process required to implant one, though this does not necessarily restore any organs replaced by the graft initially. Grafts typically require specialized storage conditions, such as alchemical tanks, to remain viable outside of a host. Grafts can usually be upgraded into their greater versions by having a grafter apply additional surgeries, mutagenic development, or similar medical procedures</p>",
  Grapple:
    "You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
  Gremlin:
    "Cruel and mischievous fey, gremlins have acclimated to life in the Universe.",
  Grimoire:
    "Spellbooks are useful tools for any magic user to write down incantations and runes of power, but where most spellbooks are nothing more than ink on parchment, grimoires have absorbed the magic of the spells within—magic that knowledgeable spellcasters can use to augment their spells.",

  Hampering:
    "After you hit with the weapon, you can use an Interact action to give the target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds. The penalty ends after the target takes a move action, at the start of your next turn, if you attack with the weapon, or if you move out of reach of the target, whichever comes first.",
  Harnessed:
    "This shield features a special brace or opening designed to hold jousting weapons.",
  Haunt:
    "A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt's unfinished business. A haunt that hasn't been properly put to rest always returns after a time.",
  Healing:
    "A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.",
  Hefty:
    "A hefty shield is so heavy that raising it takes more effort. Raising a Shield with the hefty trait is a 2-action activity unless your Strength score equals or exceeds the number with the trait.",
  Herald:
    "Nearly all deities have a specific representative known as a herald; heralds are as diverse in their appearances and abilities as the gods themselves. A creature with the herald type is always unique.",
  Hex: "A hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention. Your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call.",
  Hindering:
    "This armor is so heavy and bulky it slows you down no matter what. You take a -5 penalty to all your Speeds (to a minimum of a 5-foot Speed). This is separate from and in addition to the armor's Speed penalty, and affects you even if your Strength or an ability lets you reduce or ignore the armor's Speed penalty.",
  Hobgoblin:
    "A creature with this trait is a tall, militaristic goblinoid. Hobgoblins tend to have darkvision.",
  z: "Effects with the holy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of benevolence and virtue. They often have stronger effects on unholy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to holy causes and often have weakness to unholy. If a creature with weakness to holy uses a holy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness.",
  Hryngar:
    "Subterranean kin of the dwarves, hryngars typically have darkvision, resist poison, and recoil from bright light",

  Ikon: "An item with the ikon trait is a special item provided or created by an exemplar's divinity that is so tied to that exemplar that it can serve as a sacred vessel for their might. You gain three ikons at first level. Each ikon has a passive immanence ability and an activated transcendence ability. A feat with the ikon trait imbues one of your ikons with further capabilities. Whenever you gain a feat with the ikon trait, choose which of your ikons gains that ability; if you have multiple ikons that meet the feat's usage requirements, you can take the feat multiple times to apply its effects to another one of your ikons. These feats list what ikon they can be imbued into, and any number of them can be imbued into a single ikon.",
  Illusion:
    "Effects and magic items with this trait involve false sensory stimuli.",
  Impulse:
    "The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.",
  Incapacitation:
    "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it's harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell's rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
  Incarnate:
    "A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn't conjure a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word &quote;Arrive&quote; or &quote;Depart&quote; respectively, along with any traits. A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings. The incarnate is not fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn't block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.",
  Incorporeal:
    "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can't perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1 until the end of its turn. A corporeal and an incorporeal creature can pass through one another, but they can't end their movement in each other's space. An incorporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects—only against incorporeal ones—unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects. Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage, spirit damage, and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",
  Inevitable:
    "These constructed aeons were created by the axiomites. Each type of inevitable is dedicated to a specific task. Most inevitables have weakness to chaotic damage.",
  Infused:
    "An alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.",
  Infusion:
    "Actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. You must use an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the infusion action. Any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of the infusion action itself.",
  Ingested:
    "An ingested poison is activated by applying it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature, or by placing it directly into a living creature's mouth. A creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison when it consumes the poison or the food or drink treated with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day.",
  Inhaled:
    "An inhaled poison is activated by unleashing it from its container. Once unleashed, the poison creates a cloud filling a 10-foot cube lasting for 1 minute or until a strong wind dissipates the cloud. Every creature entering this cloud is exposed to the poison and must attempt a saving throw against it; a creature aware of the poison before entering the cloud can use a single action to hold its breath and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw for 1 round.",
  Injection:
    "This weapon can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single Interact action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance requires 3 Interact actions and uses two hands.",
  Injury:
    "An injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the first Strike made using the poisoned item. If that Strike is a success and deals piercing or slashing damage, the target must attempt a saving throw against the poison. On a failed Strike, the target is unaffected, but the poison remains on the weapon and you can try again. On a critical failure, or if the Strike fails to deal slashing or piercing damage for some other reason, the poison is spent but the target is unaffected.",
  Inscribed:
    "The armor or shield has been treated so it can be inscribed with magical symbols using the same method as Crafting a scroll. Inscribed attire can hold one scroll inscribed on it. You need a free hand to Activate the scroll, but you don't need to Interact to draw it. You can also Activate the magic to erase the scroll the armor currently contains. You can't inscribe a new scroll onto the armor if a scroll is currently inscribed on it or if the armor is broken.",

  Inventor: "This indicates abilities from the inventor class.",
  Invested:
    "A character can invest only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn't invested it, nor can it be activated, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off their head).",
  Investigator: "This indicates abilities from the investigator class.",
  Jousting:
    "The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.",

    "A stout ancestry bearing distinctive crystal horns and inherent psychic abilities.",
  Kholo: "Kholos are humanoids that resemble hyenas.",
  Kickback:
    "A kickback weapon is extra powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a -2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a kickback weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod, or other stabilizer can lower or negate this penalty.",

  Launching:
    'A mechanism within this shield can shoot projectiles, causing the shield to also function as a ranged weapon. The trait lists the type of weapon, such as "launching dart." Striking with the launcher requires the same number of hands as normal, except that the hand holding the shield counts toward this total, so a one-handed ranged weapon would require only one hand. Reloading takes the normal number of Interact actions, to a minimum of 1 action, and you can\'t use the hand holding your shield to reload.',
  Leshy:
    "A creature with this trait is a member of the leshy ancestry. These small plant or fungus creatures are humanoid in form.",

  Lozenge:
    "You Activate an alchemical lozenge by putting it in your mouth. It stays there, slowly dissolving and releasing its ingredients over time. You can bite a lozenge for a secondary effect. The action this takes is noted in the item. As soon as this secondary effect is over, the lozenge is used up and its benefits for you end. You can drink elixirs, potions, and beverages with a lozenge in your mouth, but you can't benefit from more than one lozenge at a time. If you have two lozenges in your mouth at the same time, both become inert. You can also spit out a lozenge as a single action to end its effect and make it inert. A lozenge dissolves due to its alchemical ingredients, so it typically still works even if you don't have saliva.",
  Magical:
    "Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.",

The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.",
  Minion:
    "<p>Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that's a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain the effect; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don't act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.</p><p>A minion has only 2 actions and 0 reactions per turn, though certain conditions (such as slowed or quickened) or abilities might give them a reaction that they can use.

  Morph:
    "Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait). Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.",

If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry. If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

  Possession:
    "Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can't use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",

  Relic: "An item with the relic trait grows in power with its wielder.",
  Reload:
    "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.",
  Repeating:
    "These weapons can't be loaded with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows and firearms; instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in place).

You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, affix talismans to one, make a spellgun Strike as part of an action that lets you make a firearm Strike, and so on.",
  Spellheart:
    "Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the Affix a Spellheart activity, which is otherwise identical to Affix a Talisman. The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack roll or spell DC if it's higher. Crafting a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. For example, a major five-feather wreath requires air walk, gale blast, and wall of wind.",
  Spellshape:
    "Spellshape actions tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter.

  Structure:
    "A spell, item activation, or ability with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure. The structure must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure's foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If the structure is on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a @Check[flat|dc:3] each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse.</p><p>The structure doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when it's created ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and always has a clear path of escape.

Designating this downward direction is a free action that has the concentration trait.

Unless noted otherwise, the creature must be common, it gains the summoned trait, and it must appear in an unoccupied space in range large enough to contain it. The highest level of creature the spell can summon depends on the rank of the spell, as listed below. The spell can still summon a creature of a lower level if you so choose. These rules apply only to spells that have the summon trait; other spells that call or conjure items or beings but that don't have the trait, like summon instrument, work as explained in the spell.",
  Summoned:
    "A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher rank than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects.

You can activate magic tea with an Interact action as you drink it or feed it to another creature, as if it were a potion. You can also activate magic tea with a 10-minute activity that requires sterling tea ware (these artisan's tools can be shared by up to four people who take this activity simultaneously) to prepare the tea and then consume it or present it to someone during a short tea ceremony, after which the magic tea's effects begin; activating magic tea in this way enhances its effect, as detailed in each entry's Tea Ceremony.</p><p>Once you drink a dose of magic tea, you're temporarily immune to that particular type of magic tea for 24 hours.</p>",
  Tearing:

    "A creature with telepathy can communicate mentally with creatures. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.",
  Teleportation:
    "Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.",
  Tengu:
    "A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry. Tengus are humanoids who resemble crows. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is created and used by tengus.",
  Tethered:
    "This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand (including if you've just thrown a two-handed tethered weapon and have a hand holding nothing but the weapon's tether), you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it's being held by another creature).",
  Thaumaturge: "This indicates abilities from the thaumaturge class.",
  Thrown:
    "You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.",

    "Titans are enormous, primordial creatures of neargodlike power who predate the mortal races.",
  Training:

  Transcendence:
    "Transcendence channels the might of an exemplar's divine spark through one of their ikons to surpass the mortal and enact a miraculous deed. Each ikon has an action with the transcendence trait, and using it is called Sparking Transcendence. To use the action, your divine spark must be empowering that ikon and you must have the ikon ready to use (typically holding a weapon ikon or wearing a worn ikon). Immediately after you Spark Transcendence, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon, coming to rest in another ikon of your choice. You can Spark Transcendence only once each round. As it comes from your divine spark, a transcendence action has the divine trait.",
  Trap: "A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder interlopers.",
  Trip: "You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
  Troll:
    "Trolls are giant, brutish creatures and are well known for transforming into inanimate materials.",
  Troop:

  Unarmed:
    "An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.",
  Uncommon:
    "Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.",
  Undead:

For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.",
  Vigilante:
    "Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity may risk exposing you as a vigilante. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can spend 1 week of downtime to create a new social identity.",
  Virulent:
    "Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction's stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.",
  Vishkanya: "An ancestry with snake-like features and powerful venom.",
  Visual:

  Void: "Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with void energy, deal void damage to living creatures, or manipulate void energy.",
  Volley:

  Wand: "A wand contains a single spell which you can cast once per day.",
  Wandering:
    "Wandering identifies animist feats attuned to particular types of apparitions. These feats require you to have attuned to an apparition who matches their prerequisites when you select them, and represent knowledge and ability pulled from that specific bond. When you make your daily preparations, you can retrain any wandering feat you know for any other wandering feat available at the level you took the exchanged feat (including lower-level wandering feats, as usual). You must meet all the new feat's other prerequisites.",
